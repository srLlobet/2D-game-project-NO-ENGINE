<h1>Desert Ball</h1>

<h2>Don't let the ball fall through the gaps! Find out how long you can keep the ball bouncing!</h2>

<h3>Basic Player Controls: The player can move left and right with the A and D keys.</h3>

<h3>The game features my first dabble into a game made in pure c++ without an engine. The ball has basic physics, the platforms move around and the background is a scrolling shader.</h3>
